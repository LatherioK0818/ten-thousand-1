# **LAB - Class: Ten Thousand 2**
**Project:** Ten Thousand Game Extension with AI Assistance
**Author:** Latherio Kidd  and Zachary Moore
## **Overview:** 
This lab involves working in pairs to develop a command line version of the dice game Ten Thousand, focusing on using Python's standard library and incorporating code generated by AI. The primary tasks are to handle scoring and dice rolling within the game.

## **Setup** 
`.env` requirements (where applicable):
- PORT - Port Number
- DATABASE_URL - URL to the running Postgres instance/db
## **How to Initialize/Run Your Application** 
- Run `python actual_game.py` to start the game.
## **How to Use Your Library** 
- The `Game` class manages the game rounds and scoring.
- The `GameLogic` class handles the logic and rules, including dice rolling and score calculations.
## **Tests** 
- test_calculate_score.py
- test_roll_dice.py
- test_get_scorers.py
- test_validate_keepers.py
### **Project Description** 
The project extends the Ten Thousand dice game by:
- Implementing a `GameLogic` class for scoring and dice rolling.
- Using AI-generated code blocks, with each line documented for clarity.
- Running provided tests against AI-generated code, treating the tests as the source of truth.
**Stretch Goals**
- Automated testing for all game functionalities.
**Implementation Notes**
- Review the rules of the Ten Thousand game.
- Play the game online for better understanding.
**User Acceptance Tests**
- Provided tests cover various scenarios, including dice rolling and scoring rules.
- Additional tests expected beyond the provided ones.
**Testing Criteria**
- Roll Dice: Ensure correct sequence length and value range (1-6).
- Calculate Score: Tests cover scenarios like zilch, ones, twos, threes, fours, fives, sixes, straight, three pairs, two trios, leftover ones, and leftover fives.
**Configuration**
- Continue working with your team on the ten-thousand project.
- Refer to Lab Submission Instructions for detailed instructions.
**Prompt.md File**
- Include the prompt used to generate code.
- Document the actual code received from the AI.
- Record any subsequent prompts for changes.
- Note: Failing to provide this file will result in the assignment not being graded.
